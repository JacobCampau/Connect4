<h1>Connect 4</h1>

 ### [YouTube Demonstration](link)

<h2>Description</h2>
Project consist of 1 C file to create a version of connect 4 within the terminal on your computer. The game allows for two players, give each player's name, while saving and loading games. There were 2 other contributers on this project. My main objectives were creating the save/load file functions and creating the logic for how the game would determine if a connect 4 had been made.

<br />
Select how a game should be played. Loading a game will load a saved game that is saved in a file titled "save_file". If There is no file then it won't load a game:  <br/>

<br />
'X' player will go first. All moves will be determined by selecting the column number one would like to place their piece:  <br/>

<br />
Once a connect 4 is created, the winner is displayed. The game is automatically ran again:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
If one chooses to exit part way through a game a screen asking how one would like to exit is displayed. The first exit choice just exits the program without saving. The second choice will save the game to a "save_file.txt" file and then exit the program. Saving will display an extra text to show the game has been saved:  <br/>
